#PROBLEM 1: Can't define who win the game, who lost the game --> DONE (Run more test to check further)
#PROBLEM 2: when player keep answer correctly c02 go to minus point. we don't want it go minus. it need to stay at least >0 so we have to do smt with it 
#PROBLEM 3: How to call random question and avoid duplicate question again
#PROBLEM 4: How to add call weather and add score from weather table to co2_consumed score





#TASK NEED TO BE DONE: 
#Task 1: Update question list: more questions, give users idea to put T/F, Y/N, A/B/C/D (Can you also shorten the answer: put only T for True, F for False , Y for Yes, N for No coz it also save time for us to test the code lol I'm tired of typing true, false lol)
#Task 2: How to call the different score in random weather and add on the co2consumed Score (fix the function 4: function called weather)
#Task 3: fix the function 2 called call_airport since it prints 2 times instead of 1 time (Arijana you can tried to change the code like the way you usual call sql instead of my way. Maybe it helps)
#Task 4: make a while loop statement in every input part so if player dont answer yes/no or don't input the result as we expect, the question is asked again until they answer as we want to proceed to next step
