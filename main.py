#PROBLEM 1: Can't define who win the game, who lost the game --> DONE (Run more test to check further)
#PROBLEM 2: when player keep answer correctly c02 go to minus point. we don't want it go minus. it need to stay at least >0 so we have to do smt with it  --> DONE
#PROBLEM 3: How to call random question and avoid duplicate question again --> DONE
#PROBLEM 4: How to add call weather and add score from weather table to co2_consumed score --> DONE
